I have 9+ years of experience in front-end web development for large & complex enterprise SPA (mostly with `Angular`). Predominantly my experience is in the fields of Healthcare, CivicTech or FinTech. Besides pure code construction, I contribute to architecture, development process refinement and introduction of the best practices for the team to follow.
